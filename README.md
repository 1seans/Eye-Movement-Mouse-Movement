# Eye-Movement-Mouse-Movement
## A JavaScript function that moves two elements on a web page based on the mouse position.

How to Run:
To use this function, include it in your JavaScript code and assign it to the onmousemove event of the document object. The elements to be moved should be identified by the ball class name and stored in the balls array.

Roadmap of future improvements:
There are several potential improvements that could be made to this function in the future. For example, the function could be modified to move more than two elements, or to allow the user to specify which elements should be moved. Additionally, the movement of the elements could be made more smooth or responsive by using different CSS properties or by implementing animation techniques.
